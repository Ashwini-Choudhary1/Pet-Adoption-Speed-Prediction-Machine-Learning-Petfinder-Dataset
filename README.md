# Pet-Adoption-Speed-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Petfinder-Dataset

ML project to predict pet adoption speed using various data types and models.

Goal: Predict pet adoption speed using machine learning models.

Dataset: Petfinder dataset with images, text, categorical, and numerical variables.

Train set: 9,000 elements. Test set: 500 elements.

Data Processing: Preprocessing the dataset and handling different data types (images, text, categorical, numerical).

Model Pipeline: Created transformers and implemented a pipeline for seamless data transformation and model training.

Model Selection & Optimization: Focused on selecting the best machine learning model and tuning hyper-parameters for better performance.

Evaluation Metric: Used the Quadratic Kappa Metric to evaluate model performance.
